omidb documentation
===================

A command-line interface and Python package to work with the `OPTIMAM Mammography Image Database <https://medphys.royalsurrey.nhs.uk/omidb/>`_

..  note:: This project is still in early development, and should be
    considered experimental (pre-alpha) until the OMI-DB NBSS data has been fully
    modelled, and a stable API has been established. Issues and feedback are welcome:
    please `raise an issue <https://bitbucket.org/scicomcore/omi-db/issues?status=new&status=open>`_.
